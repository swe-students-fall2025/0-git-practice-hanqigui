<Little Project>

I recently browsed a very interesting website:
- **(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website)**

**Why I Choose**
- **Clear Procedure**: It teaches newer from the zero with clear and understandable sequences to guide learners.
- **MVP**: It starts from the min avaiable product and then gradually improve it.
- **Authentic**: It creates by Mozilla and continues updates.
